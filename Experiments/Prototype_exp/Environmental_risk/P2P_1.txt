# Environmental and Sustainability Risks in the Purchase to Pay Process at Walmart
The retail industry is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by the need to integrate sustainability into every aspect of business operations. As one of the largest retail giants, Walmart is at the forefront of this shift, particularly in its purchase to pay (P2P) process. The P2P process encompasses various stages, including requisition, approval, purchasing, receiving, and payment, each carrying potential environmental and sustainability risks. This report focuses on the 'Reject Invoice -> Receive Invoice' step, a critical juncture where environmental considerations are paramount.

At this stage, the environmental and sustainability risks are multifaceted. The use of paper-based invoicing, for instance, has been identified as a significant contributor to deforestation, water consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions ([Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-023-28689-1)). Walmart's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint is evident in its initiatives such as Project Gigaton, which targets the reduction of emissions across its supply chain ([Retail Dive](https://www.retaildive.com/news/walmart-project-gigaton-scope-3-supplier-emissions-ron-voglewede/711243/)). However, the transition from paper-based to electronic invoicing is not without challenges. It requires robust technology infrastructure, changes in supplier behavior, and alignment with global sustainability standards.

Moreover, the rejection of invoices can lead to additional processing, which may increase the carbon footprint due to the use of ICT resources and the potential for increased transportation if physical documents are involved. Walmart's P2P system aims to mitigate these risks by automating and integrating payment activities, thus enhancing efficiency and reducing manual errors ([Robots.net](https://robots.net/fintech/how-does-walmarts-p2p-work/)).

The environmental impact of the 'Reject Invoice -> Receive Invoice' step is also influenced by Walmart's ability to manage its supply chain's energy use, waste, packaging, and product lifecycle ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/13/walmart-climate-change-plan-can-it-work)). As Walmart continues to advance its sustainability agenda, it is imperative to assess and address the risks associated with this critical step in the P2P process. This report will provide a systematic analysis of these risks, offering insights into how Walmart can further reduce its environmental impact while maintaining operational efficiency.

# Environmental Impact of Invoice Processing at Walmart

## Deforestation and Paper Manufacturing
The traditional paper invoicing process at large retailers like Walmart can contribute to deforestation, as the paper industry relies heavily on trees as the primary raw material. Deforestation not only leads to the loss of biodiversity and wildlife habitats but also exacerbates climate change by reducing the number of trees available to absorb carbon dioxide ([Genio](https://www.genio.ac/guides/exploring-the-environmental-impacts-of-paper-invoicing/)).

## Energy Consumption and Carbon Emissions
The production of paper invoices is energy-intensive, involving the consumption of water and energy, which results in carbon emissions and other pollutants. Additionally, the transportation and delivery of physical invoices contribute to air pollution through vehicle emissions. This aspect of the invoice processing step has a significant carbon footprint that affects Walmart's sustainability goals ([Genio](https://www.genio.ac/guides/exploring-the-environmental-impacts-of-paper-invoicing/)).

## Waste Generation and Methane Emissions
When paper invoices are discarded and end up in landfills, they can release methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Methane contributes significantly to global warming, and proper waste management practices such as recycling or composting can help mitigate these emissions. However, not all paper invoices are recycled, and many still end up in landfills, posing a challenge for Walmart's waste management efforts ([Genio](https://www.genio.ac/guides/exploring-the-environmental-impacts-of-paper-invoicing/)).

## The Impact of Ink and Other Materials
The ink used for printing invoices often contains harmful chemicals and solvents that can contaminate water sources and harm ecosystems. Additionally, adhesive labels and plastic envelopes used in the paper invoicing process contribute to waste generation and increase the environmental footprint of Walmart's invoice processing ([Genio](https://www.genio.ac/guides/exploring-the-environmental-impacts-of-paper-invoicing/)).

## Transitioning to Digital Invoicing
Walmart's move towards digital invoicing can significantly reduce the environmental impact associated with paper invoicing. Electronic invoicing eliminates the need for paper, reducing deforestation, energy consumption, and waste. It also offers the potential for improved efficiency and accuracy in the invoice processing step, aligning with Walmart's sustainability initiatives and Project Gigaton goals ([Supply Chain Dive](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/walmart-project-gigaton-scope-3-supplier-emissions-ron-voglewede/710733/); [Genio](https://www.genio.ac/guides/uncovering-the-invoicing-trends-that-will-dominate-2024/)).


# Sustainability Initiatives in Retail Payment Operations at Walmart

## Electronic Invoicing and Payment Systems

Walmart has been implementing electronic invoicing and payment systems to reduce the environmental impact associated with traditional paper-based processes. By transitioning to electronic systems, Walmart significantly cuts down on paper usage, which in turn reduces the demand for wood pulp and the deforestation associated with it. Electronic systems also minimize the need for physical storage and the associated energy consumption. The adoption of these systems aligns with Walmart's broader sustainability goals, including efforts to reduce waste and improve efficiency in operations.

## Supplier Engagement and Sustainability Scorecards

Walmart engages with its suppliers through sustainability scorecards that evaluate their environmental performance, including their invoicing and payment practices. Suppliers are encouraged to adopt electronic invoicing and payments to align with Walmart's sustainability initiatives. This engagement not only promotes more sustainable practices across the supply chain but also helps in tracking and reducing the carbon footprint associated with the 'Reject Invoice -> Receive Invoice' step in the purchase to pay process.

## Data Analytics for Environmental Impact Reduction

Through the use of advanced data analytics, Walmart can optimize its invoicing and payment operations to minimize environmental impact. By analyzing transaction data, Walmart can identify patterns and areas for improvement, such as reducing the frequency of invoice rejections which lead to additional processing and associated environmental costs. This data-driven approach enables Walmart to make informed decisions that support sustainability objectives.

## Renewable Energy-Powered Payment Processing

Walmart's commitment to renewable energy extends to its payment processing infrastructure. By ensuring that the data centers and servers handling electronic invoicing and payments are powered by renewable energy sources, Walmart reduces the carbon emissions associated with these operations. This initiative is part of Walmart's broader goal to power its facilities with 100% renewable energy and contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the retail payment process.

## Circular Economy and Closed-Loop Systems

In line with the principles of a circular economy, Walmart is exploring closed-loop systems for its payment operations. This involves creating a system where resources, including the technology and equipment used for processing payments, are reused, refurbished, or recycled at the end of their lifecycle. By adopting a closed-loop approach, Walmart aims to minimize waste and promote resource efficiency in its payment operations, contributing to a more sustainable retail environment.

These initiatives demonstrate Walmart's commitment to integrating sustainability into every aspect of its operations, including the 'Reject Invoice -> Receive Invoice' step in the purchase to pay process. Through electronic invoicing, supplier engagement, data analytics, renewable energy usage, and closed-loop systems, Walmart is addressing the environmental and sustainability risks associated with retail payment operations.


# Digital Invoicing and Carbon Footprint Reduction

## Adoption of Electronic Invoicing Systems
The transition from paper-based to electronic invoicing (e-invoicing) systems is a significant step in reducing the carbon footprint associated with the 'Reject Invoice -> Receive Invoice' step in the purchase to pay process. E-invoicing eliminates the need for paper, thus reducing deforestation and the carbon emissions from paper production and transportation. For a retail giant like Walmart, which processes a vast number of invoices, the shift to e-invoicing can lead to substantial environmental benefits ([UNCTAD, 2021](https://unctad.org/news/quantifying-environmental-benefits-paperless-trade-facilitation)).

## Impact of Digitalization on Carbon Emissions
Digitalization of invoices not only reduces paper use but also cuts down on emissions related to physical delivery and storage. A study found a 63% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per invoice when switching from paper to digital e-invoices ([UNCTAD, 2021](https://unctad.org/news/quantifying-environmental-benefits-paperless-trade-facilitation)). However, it is essential to consider the increased demand for electricity to power servers and computers, which can partially offset these gains. Despite this, the net effect of going paperless is generally a reduction in emissions.

## Efficiency Gains from E-Invoicing
Efficiency gains from e-invoicing are a major contributor to emission reductions. By streamlining the invoice process, less work is required to complete transactions, leading to a decrease in office space usage, commuting, and other resource consumption. For Walmart, this means optimizing the supply chain and reducing the environmental impact of their operations ([OpenText, 2024](https://www.opentext.com/assets/documents/en-US/pdf/opentext-pp-2024-guide-to-global-e-Invoicing-mandates-en.pdf)).

## Global E-Invoicing Mandates and Compliance
Walmart must also navigate the evolving landscape of global e-invoicing mandates. Countries are increasingly requiring businesses to adopt e-invoicing for tax reporting and VAT compliance, which can have implications for Walmart's international operations. Adhering to these mandates can further promote sustainability by ensuring better systems and processes that contribute to carbon footprint reduction ([UnifiedPost Group, 2024](https://www.unifiedpostgroup.com/news/2024s-electronic-invoicing-changes)).

## Digital Carbon Footprint Considerations
While e-invoicing reduces the carbon footprint associated with paper invoices, it is important to manage the digital carbon footprint. This includes the energy consumption of data centers and digital devices. Walmart can mitigate this by using energy-efficient hardware, virtualization, cloud computing, and investing in renewable energy sources to power their digital infrastructure ([Nutanix, n.d.](https://www.nutanix.com/info/digital-carbon-footprint)).

In summary, the adoption of e-invoicing in the 'Reject Invoice -> Receive Invoice' step is a key sustainability initiative that can significantly reduce Walmart's environmental impact. By focusing on efficiency gains, complying with global mandates, and managing the digital carbon footprint, Walmart can contribute to a more sustainable retail sector.
