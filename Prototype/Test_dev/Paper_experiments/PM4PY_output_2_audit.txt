Can you find the audit risks in my process? And give me causes for why they might be happening? The process is an order-to-cash process at Procter and Gamble. I will now give you the DFG abstraction of the process: 
If I have a process with flow:

Order Received -> Order Validation ( frequency = 70000  performance = 216372.415 )
Order Validation -> Customer Credit Check ( frequency = 63072  performance = 391788.810 )
Payment Received -> Order Completed ( frequency = 53530  performance = 190832.753 )
Order Approval -> Order Confirmation Sent ( frequency = 39690  performance = 64140.298 )
Order Confirmation Sent -> Prepare Goods for Shipment ( frequency = 38119  performance = 363528.248 )
Prepare Goods for Shipment -> Goods Shipped ( frequency = 37663  performance = 161225.308 )
Customer Credit Check -> Order Approval ( frequency = 35102  performance = 150234.508 )
Send Invoice -> Payment Received ( frequency = 34168  performance = 199630.362 )
Goods Shipped -> Send Invoice ( frequency = 32561  performance = 62525.077 )
Customer Credit Check -> Customer Credit Check ( frequency = 27826  performance = 232651.050 )
Prepare Goods for Shipment -> Send Invoice ( frequency = 21018  performance = 175118.150 )
Goods Shipped -> Payment Received ( frequency = 20969  performance = 108023.372 )
Order Confirmation Sent -> Order Approval ( frequency = 19759  performance = 65798.510 )
Send Invoice -> Goods Shipped ( frequency = 19411  performance = 103830.620 )
Order Approval -> Prepare Goods for Shipment ( frequency = 19004  performance = 298758.249 )
Customer Credit Check -> Order Confirmation Sent ( frequency = 17419  performance = 214266.362 )
Order Validation -> Order Validation ( frequency = 13913  performance = 232620.000 )
Order Rejected -> Order Completed ( frequency = 10551  performance = 345600.000 )
Customer Credit Check -> Order Rejected ( frequency = 10551  performance = 173545.181 )
Order Validation -> Order Approval ( frequency = 4588  performance = 320696.077 )
Payment Received -> Goods Shipped ( frequency = 2375  performance = 86400.000 )
Goods Shipped -> Order Completed ( frequency = 2375  performance = 86400.000 )
Order Validation -> Order Confirmation Sent ( frequency = 2340  performance = 384000.000 )
Send Invoice -> Prepare Goods for Shipment ( frequency = 2326  performance = 86400.000 )
Order Confirmation Sent -> Send Invoice ( frequency = 1571  performance = 345600.000 )
Prepare Goods for Shipment -> Payment Received ( frequency = 768  performance = 259200.000 )
Order Approval -> Send Invoice ( frequency = 755  performance = 259200.000 )

Based on the DFG abstraction of the order-to-cash process at Procter and Gamble, some potential audit risks and their possible causes include:

1. Duplicate Orders:
- Cause: The frequency of "Order Validation -> Order Validation" is 13913, indicating a potential risk of duplicate orders being validated.
- Root Cause: Lack of system controls to prevent duplicate orders from entering the system.

2. Inaccurate Credit Checks:
- Cause: The frequency of "Customer Credit Check -> Customer Credit Check" is 27826, suggesting multiple credit checks being performed on the same customer.
- Root Cause: Inadequate integration between systems leading to repeated credit check requests.

3. Delayed Payments:
- Cause: The performance time for "Payment Received -> Goods Shipped" is 86400, indicating a potential delay in payments being processed.
- Root Cause: Inefficient payment processing systems or delays in reconciliation between payment received and goods shipped.

4. Manual Order Approvals:
- Cause: The performance time for "Order Validation -> Order Approval" is 320696.077, suggesting a lengthy approval process.
- Root Cause: Manual order approval processes leading to delays in order processing.

5. Inaccurate Invoicing:
- Cause: The frequency of "Send Invoice -> Prepare Goods for Shipment" is 2326, indicating potential issues with invoicing being sent before goods are ready for shipment.
- Root Cause: Lack of synchronization between invoicing and shipment preparation processes, leading to incorrect or premature invoices.

6. Invalid Orders:
- Cause: The frequency of "Order Rejected -> Order Completed" is 10551, indicating a significant number of rejected orders that are still being completed.
- Root Cause: Inadequate order rejection processes or lack of proper communication between order validation and completion stages.
