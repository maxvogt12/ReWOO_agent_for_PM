# Geopolitical Risks Impacting the Purchase to Pay Process in the Furniture Retail Sector: An IKEA Perspective

The global furniture retail sector, exemplified by industry leader IKEA, is navigating a complex and risk-laden landscape as it manages the critical 'Create Purchase Requisition -> Validate Invoice' step in the purchase to pay (P2P) process. This stage is foundational to procurement efficiency and business growth, yet it is increasingly vulnerable to a myriad of geopolitical risks that can disrupt operations and impact financial performance.

In recent years, the geopolitical environment has become a central concern for procurement professionals, with events such as the ongoing [war between Russia and Ukraine](https://www.resilinc.com/blog/geopolitical-supply-chain-risks-2024/), the [Israel-Hamas conflict](https://www.resilinc.com/blog/geopolitical-supply-chain-risks-2024/), and the [crisis in the Red Sea](https://www.resilinc.com/blog/geopolitical-supply-chain-risks-2024/) sending shockwaves through global supply chains. These conflicts have led to increased shipping rates, access restrictions to critical materials, and heightened insurance premiums, directly affecting the P2P process.

The [Red Sea Crisis](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dennismitzner/2024/02/19/red-sea-tensions-impact-on-global-trade-retail-and-manufacturing/), in particular, has caused major shipping companies to reroute from the Suez Canal, leading to longer transit times and higher costs. This has a direct bearing on the furniture retail sector, where companies like IKEA rely on timely and cost-effective transportation of goods from diverse global suppliers.

Furthermore, the [supply chain trends outlook for 2024](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/supply-chain-trends-outlook-2024/706096/) indicates that elevated operating costs, labor tensions, and fluctuating freight demand continue to pose risks to transportation modes critical to IKEA's supply chain. These factors can lead to delays and increased costs during the 'Create Purchase Requisition' phase, potentially causing a ripple effect through to 'Validate Invoice' and beyond.

In addition to these direct supply chain impacts, IKEA must also navigate broader geopolitical trends, such as the [shifting focus of the global economy](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/pl/Documents/Reports/Global-Retail-Outlook-2024.pdf) from goods to services, inflationary pressures, and consumer shifts towards more cost-conscious purchasing behaviors. These trends necessitate a strategic approach to procurement and risk management, ensuring that IKEA can maintain its commitment to sustainability and ethical practices, including [combating child labor](https://medium.com/discourse/is-ikea-ethical-and-sustainable-6121b334e77e) and reducing its environmental impact.

As we stand in April 2024, it is clear that IKEA, along with the entire furniture retail sector, must remain vigilant and proactive in the face of these geopolitical risks. The ability to adapt procurement strategies, leverage technology such as [predictive analytics](https://www.goodfirms.co/inventory-management-software/blog/ikea-works-hard-to-mitigate-global-supply-chain-disruption), and maintain robust supplier relationships will be critical in navigating the uncertainties of the 'Create Purchase Requisition -> Validate Invoice' step in the P2P process.

# Assessment of Geopolitical Risks Impacting Furniture Retail Supply Chains

## Global Political Instability and Trade Disruptions

The furniture retail sector, including companies like IKEA, is susceptible to global political instability which can lead to trade disruptions. The ongoing conflict in regions such as the Middle East, particularly the Red Sea attacks, has already prompted major shipping companies to reroute their vessels, adding significant delays and costs to the supply chain ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/21/ikea-warns-red-sea-attacks-could-disrupt-supplies-and-deliveries)). This instability can affect the 'Create Purchase Requisition -> Validate Invoice' step by causing unpredictability in the availability and cost of goods, leading to challenges in fulfilling purchase requisitions and validating invoices due to fluctuating prices and delayed deliveries.

## Economic Sanctions and Trade Barriers

Economic sanctions and trade barriers imposed in response to geopolitical events can have a direct impact on the furniture retail sector's supply chain. For instance, the sanctions and export controls resulting from Russia's actions in Ukraine have disrupted the flow of natural gas, oil, and grain, causing companies to reconsider their supply chains ([Foley](https://www.foley.com/insights/publications/2022/07/avoid-supply-chain-disruption-geopolitical-risk/)). These disruptions can lead to increased costs and scarcity of materials, which in turn can complicate the purchase requisition process and lead to discrepancies during invoice validation.

## Climate Change and Environmental Policies

Climate change poses significant risks to global supply chains, with extreme weather events topping the list of immediate threats ([World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2024/01/global-risks-report-2024/)). Furniture retailers may face challenges in sourcing materials and ensuring the timely transportation of goods. Additionally, environmental policies aimed at combating climate change could lead to changes in regulations, affecting the sourcing and manufacturing of furniture. These factors can influence the 'Create Purchase Requisition' step by necessitating adjustments to sourcing strategies and could lead to increased scrutiny during the 'Validate Invoice' step to ensure compliance with new regulations.
